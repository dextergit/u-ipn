    <h2>Introduction to the Web</h2>
    <p>
      <b>WWW</b>, also known as the <em>world wide web</em> or simply <em>web</em> is a collection of hypertext documents.
    HTML is a markup language used most <em>web</em> documents. The web also contains plain text files, video files, image files, and music files.

      <h2>Mark Up</h2>
      HTML documents consist of tags, which generally come in pairs (opening tag + closing tag).
      A pair of tags along with the text within is sometimes referred to as an element.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tags can change the appearance of text to make them <b>bold</b> or in <em>italics</em>.
      Tags can have one or more attributes and which can be used to specify things like links to other web pages (such as in anchor tags).
      Image tags use attributes to specify the source of the image as well as some user friendly text to display in case the source cannot be located.
    </p>

    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    A web site with plenty of HTML document is <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">W3 Schools</a>.

    <h2>White Space</h2>
    Paragraph tags and line break tags can can be used to create white space in a web page. The paragraph tag actually creates an invisible box around the text.
    This invsible box, or block, can have other attributes such as height and width.

    <h2>Boxes and Containers</h2>
    Span and div elements tags are simply used to contain tags. They have an attribute called class which is used to specify a certain CSS style.
    Span is inline, while div is block.

    <h2>Document Structure</h2>
    HTML document structure starts with a <em>DOCTYPE</em> which is the first line on the page. There are also html, body, title, and head tags that form the document
    structure. The head section can also contain things like the title of the document and meta data for Java Script and CSS. This course will focus mostly on things
    within the body tag, which is essentially the contents of a web page.

    <div>Indentation of HTML document components facilitate readability.
      <span>This is a good practice since it will make the document easier to use for current and future web developers.</span>
