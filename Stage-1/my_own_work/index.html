        HTML documents consist of tags, which generally come in pairs (opening tag + closing tag).
        A pair of tags along with the text within is sometimes referred to as an element.

      <p>
        Tags can change the appearance of text to make them <b>bold</b> or in <em>italics</em>.
        Tags can have one or more attributes and which can be used to specify things like links to other web pages (such as in anchor tags).
        Image tags use attributes to specify the source of the image as well as some user friendly text to display in case the source cannot be located.
